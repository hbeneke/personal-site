## The Most Popular Framework Nobody's Paying For

Let me tell you a story that sounds like it was written by a particularly pessimistic sci-fi author. Tailwind CSS, one of the most successful CSS frameworks ever created, is at the peak of its popularity. Millions of developers use it daily. Major companies like Shopify, Reddit, Rivian, and even NASA rely on it. V4 launched to critical acclaim. Everyone loves it.

And yet, 75% of the engineering team just lost their jobs.

[Adam Wathan](https://twitter.com/adamwathan), the creator of Tailwind, recently had to lay off three out of four engineers on his team. Revenue is down 80%. Documentation traffic has dropped 40% since early 2023. The company that built one of the most influential tools in modern web development is fighting for survival.

The culprit? That digital friend we've all been getting cozy with - artificial intelligence.

## The Pull Request That Opened Pandora's Box

This whole drama came to light because of a GitHub pull request. Someone submitted a PR to add `llms.txt` support to the Tailwind documentation - a simple file that helps AI models better understand and use the framework. Seems harmless, right? The kind of community contribution that open source projects typically welcome with open arms.

But Adam's response caught everyone off guard. He essentially said: "I've got more important things to worry about right now, like figuring out how to keep the lights on."

The reasoning was brutally honest. If AI models can read their documentation directly, fewer humans visit the actual docs website. Fewer visitors means fewer people discover their paid products like Tailwind Plus. Less discovery means less revenue. Less revenue means... well, you already know how this story ends.

The internet, being the internet, responded with the empathy and understanding of a swarm of particularly angry hornets. Adam eventually had to lock the thread because it was "spiraling a bit."

## When Being Too Good Becomes Your Downfall

Here's where we enter truly absurd territory. Tailwind is growing faster than ever. More developers are using it than at any point in its history. By every metric that should matter, it's a massive success.

But those same AI tools that recommend Tailwind to developers? They learned from the documentation. They can write Tailwind code without developers ever visiting the docs. They can replicate the patterns from Tailwind Plus without anyone paying for it. The very thing that made Tailwind successful - its clean, learnable utility-first approach - made it the perfect training data for AI models.

It's like being a chef whose recipes are so good that everyone memorizes them instead of coming back to your restaurant. Congrats, you've achieved culinary immortality! Also, you're bankrupt.

Adam explained it in his podcast "Adam's Morning Walk" (yes, it's literally him talking while walking, and yes, it's 33 minutes of existential crisis we can all relate to). He admitted they saw the revenue declining but did what all founders do - they ignored the numbers until they couldn't anymore. By the time they looked closely, they had about 6 months of runway left.

## The Cavalry Arrives (Fashionably Late)

After the news broke, the tech world suddenly remembered that open source projects need money to survive. Vercel stepped up as a sponsor. Google AI Studio joined in. Cursor, Polar, and a bunch of other companies appeared on the sponsors page.

Which is great! Really, it is. But here's the thing that bothers me: why did it take a crisis? These companies have been making billions partly because of tools like Tailwind. V0, Vercel's AI tool, generates Tailwind code all day long. Cursor recommends Tailwind constantly. They've been benefiting from this ecosystem for years.

It's like watching someone drown for twenty minutes and then rushing in to help only after they've already swallowed half the pool. The gesture is appreciated, but the timing leaves something to be desired.

There's already speculation that Vercel might acquire Tailwind entirely - similar to how they brought Rich Harris (creator of Svelte) in-house. It would make sense strategically. Whether that's good for the ecosystem long-term is a different question entirely.

## The Uncomfortable Truth About Open Source Sustainability

This isn't just a Tailwind problem. [Christopher Chedeau](https://twitter.com/vjeux) (vjeux), the creator of React Native, Prettier, and Excalidraw, chimed in saying he's had similar issues with Prettier. It's used by virtually every JavaScript developer on the planet, yet funding proper maintenance has been a constant struggle. For Excalidraw, he went the SaaS route, which has worked better.

The traditional open source monetization strategies are dying. Consulting? AI can answer most questions now. Templates and UI kits? Claude can generate decent alternatives. Training and courses? Why pay when you can have an AI tutor available 24/7?

The irony is thick enough to cut with a knife. The AI companies that benefit most from open source training data are the same ones destroying the business models that kept those projects alive. It's not malicious - it's just the cold logic of technology eating its own tail.

## My Take: Progress Is Messy (And That's Okay)

Look, I'm genuinely sad about those layoffs. Three engineers who were working on something millions of people use every day suddenly don't have jobs. That sucks. There's no other way to put it.

But here's where I might lose some of you: we can't stop progress because it's uncomfortable.

Open source has always been a complicated beast. The same philosophy that makes it beautiful - free access to knowledge and tools - is also what makes it economically fragile. You're essentially giving away the core product and hoping people pay for something else. Sometimes that works. Sometimes it doesn't.

The introduction of AI has accelerated these contradictions to a breaking point. But the contradictions were always there. AI just made them impossible to ignore.

I've been using Tailwind for years. I appreciate what Adam and his team built. But I also recognize that the world doesn't owe anyone a business model. If AI can do something better, faster, or cheaper, people will use AI. That's not cruelty - that's just reality.

The question isn't whether we should slow down AI to protect existing business models (we shouldn't). The question is what comes next. How do we fund the next Tailwind? The next React? The next tool that fundamentally changes how we build software?

## What Actually Needs to Happen

Some ideas are already floating around. One proposal suggests an AI Content Protocol (AICP) that would let projects monetize AI consumption without hurting the community. Others suggest that AI companies should be legally required to pay licensing fees for training data. The "MIT License doesn't cover AI training" argument is gaining traction in legal circles.

But honestly? I don't think we've figured this out yet. And that's okay. We're in the messy middle of a massive transition. Some projects will die. Others will adapt. New funding models will emerge.

What I do know is that yelling at Adam Wathan on GitHub isn't the answer. Neither is demanding that open source maintainers keep working for free while billion-dollar companies profit from their work. We need actual, systemic solutions.

In the meantime, if you use Tailwind (or any open source project), consider sponsoring it. Buy their book - "Refactoring UI" is genuinely excellent and it'll make you better at design. Subscribe to Tailwind Plus if you can afford it. Support the ecosystem that supports you.

Because here's the uncomfortable truth: if we don't figure this out, we might not get a Tailwind V5. Or a new React. Or any of the innovative tools we've come to expect. And that would be a loss for everyone - including the AI companies that need this training data to exist in the first place.

## The Bigger Picture

We're watching open source economics being rewritten in real-time. Tailwind is just the canary in the coal mine. Prettier is struggling. How many other projects are quietly dying while we assume everything is fine?

The old social contract was simple: maintainers give their time, companies give some money, everyone benefits. AI has shattered that contract by removing the human-in-the-loop that made monetization possible.

Some developers have responded by going closed-source entirely. Can't blame them. When your open contributions become training data that directly competes with your ability to earn a living, the incentives get weird fast.

I don't have all the answers. I'm not sure anyone does right now. But I do know that the solution isn't hostility toward the people trying to keep these projects alive. Adam Wathan built something incredible. The fact that the economics have shifted isn't his failure - it's a structural problem that affects everyone in this industry.

So yeah, the Tailwind situation is sad. It's also a wake-up call. How we respond to it will shape the future of open source for decades to come.

No pressure or anything.
