            <h2 class="text-sm font-semibold mb-2 secondary">How It Started</h2>
            <p class="text-xs leading-relaxed mb-2">
              I learned to code as a kid with BASIC. My mom worked at a bank and
              they asked her to learn programming to manage the company's
              software. She didn't understand computers, but I was enthusiastic
              about them, so she asked me to learn together. That's how it all
              began.
            </p>
            <p class="text-xs leading-relaxed">
              Professionally, I've been at it for over 10 years across different
              sectors: startups, banking, marketing, telecom, renewable energy.
              Built real-time ad platforms, omnichannel contact centers, ETL
              pipelines for big data, and led development teams. Currently
              working as a Senior Full Stack Developer and Tech Lead.

            <h2 class="text-sm font-semibold mb-2 secondary">What I'm Into</h2>
            <p class="text-xs leading-relaxed mb-2">
              I work mainly with Angular/Vue, TypeScript, and modern web
              technologies. Also comfortable with Python, PHP/Laravel when
              needed.
            </p>
            <p class="text-xs leading-relaxed">
              I like building projects that challenge me, tinkering with new
              technologies, and exploring different paradigms. Performance
              optimization, code reviews, and architecture decisions are things
              I naturally gravitate towards.

          I like helping the developer community. Used to organize Betabeers
          events in Madrid (2014-2017) and won a few Startup Weekend
          competitions along the way. If you're building a startup from scratch
          and need someone who's been there before, I'd love to collaborate and
          help get things off the ground.
