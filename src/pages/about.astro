          <h2 class="text-sm font-semibold mb-2 secondary">How It Started</h2>
          <p class="text-xs leading-relaxed mb-2">
            I learned to code as a kid with BASIC. My mom worked at a bank and
            they asked her to learn programming to manage the company's
            software. She didn't understand computers, but I was enthusiastic
            about them, so she asked me to learn together. That's how it all
            began.
          </p>
          <p class="text-xs leading-relaxed">
            Professionally, I've been at it for over 10 years across different
            sectors: startups, banking, marketing, telecom, renewable energy.
            Built real-time ad platforms, omnichannel contact centers, ETL
            pipelines for big data, and led development teams. Currently working
            as a Senior Full Stack Developer and Tech Lead.

        <div>
          <h2 class="text-sm font-semibold mb-2 secondary">What I'm Into</h2>
          <p class="text-xs leading-relaxed mb-2">
            I work mainly with Angular/Vue, TypeScript, and modern web
            technologies. Also comfortable with Python, PHP/Laravel when needed.
          </p>
          <p class="text-xs leading-relaxed">
            I like building projects that challenge me, tinkering with new
            technologies, and exploring different paradigms. Performance
            optimization, code reviews, and architecture decisions are things I
            naturally gravitate towards.

          I like helping the developer community. Used to organize Betabeers
          events in Madrid (2014-2017) and won a few Startup Weekend
          competitions along the way. If you're building a startup from scratch
          and need someone who's been there before, I'd love to collaborate and
          help get things off the ground.
